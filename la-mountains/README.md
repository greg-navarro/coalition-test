# Coalition Technologies Technical Test

This project is for the Coalition Technologies technical screener.  As per the instructions, a provided photoshop .psd file was used to implement a website for a fictional organization named 'Los Angeles Mountains'.

All work was done in pure React code, without the assistance of any UI sets or component libraries.

Anyways, good project, learned a lot.

## Running the project

`cd la-mountains`

In the project directory you can run:
